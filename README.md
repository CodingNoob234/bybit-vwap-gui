# bybit-vwap-gui
As an introduction to TKinter, I build this simple application that shows bitcoin price data from exchange ByBit. The application plots ohlc-candlebars of the past trading history. As indicators, the VWAP alongside the Bollinger bands are plotted as well. The user can determine for which frequency (1/5/15/60/240 minutes) the candlebars are shown.
